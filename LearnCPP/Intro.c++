In C++ programs, including header files from the standard library is essential to utilize built-in elements like classes and constants. 
For example, `#include <iostream>` allows access to input and output functions.
 The iostream library offers additional features and error handling beyond basic input and output.
 Header files can be system-defined or user-defined. 
For more information on header files, refer to the documentation.*/
